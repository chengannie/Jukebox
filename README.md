Jukebox
=======

Jukebox is an iOS app that makes collaborative music playing easier when there's only one set of speakers in the car or room that a phone can be plugged into. One person can start playing music from his/her phone, and others can vote on upcoming songs to alter the playlist according to what the crowd wants. It's powered by Parse and written in Objective-C.
