Jukebox
=======

Jukebox is an iOS app that makes collaborative music playing easier when there's only one set of speakers in the car or room that a phone can be plugged into. One person can start playing music from his/her phone, and others can vote on upcoming songs to alter the playlist according to what the crowd wants. It's powered by Parse and written in Objective-C.

A user is greeted with a list of existing rooms. These rooms are sorted based on location. A user can join an existing room as a "listener", or they can create a new room and serve as a "DJ".

Users can switch between the home screen, the profile, or choose to log out.

The DJ can start playing music from his/her personal iPod library and then plug his/her phone into the speakers.

The listener can see the currently playing song, the song that's coming up next, and other songs from the DJ's playlist. Each listener can like or dislike a song in the "song bucket". The song with the most votes will be moved to the "up next" slot once the current song is done playing.
