Jukebox
=======

Jukebox is an iOS app that makes collaborative music playing easier when there's only one set of speakers in the car or room that a phone can be plugged into. One person can start playing music from his/her phone, and others can vote on upcoming songs to alter the playlist according to what the crowd wants. It's powered by Parse and written in Objective-C.

A user is greeted with a list of existing rooms. These rooms are sorted based on location. A user can join an existing room as a "listener", or they can create a new room and serve as a "DJ".

The listener can see the currently playing song, the song that's coming up next, and other songs from the DJ's playlist. Each listener can like or dislike a song in the "song bucket". The song with the most votes will be moved to the "up next" slot once the current song is done playing.
